<p>In the summer of 2018, Carruthers gathered up 27 selected paintings that would comprise the <b>slippages</b>  series and temporarily relocated to Vancouver to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Girard_(conductor)">Dr. Jonathan Girard</a>, Director of Orchestras at the University of British Columbia School of Music and the <a href="https://music.ubc.ca/symphony-orchestra">UBC Symphony Orchestra</a> (UBCSO). Conversations took place between Carruthers and Girard regarding how best to translate the visual into the auditory.</p>

Three paintings selected from the 27-page *‘slippages’*  graphic score shown with the transparent overlay developed by the Maestro and the artist to transform visual expression into sound.

Carruthers and Girard struck upon an ingenious solution. They created a geography of the orchestra on a sheet of transparent plastic and used it to map over Carruthers’ art works. Dr. Girard recounts: “We created a transparent overlay of the seating chart and went page by page, figuring out which instruments would take responsibility for which parts of the images.”
