In the summer of 2018, Carruthers gathered up 27 selected paintings that would comprise the ‘slippages’ series and temporarily relocated to Vancouver to work with Dr. Jonathan Girard, Director of Orchestras at the University of British Columbia School of Music and the UBC Symphony Orchestra (UBCSO). Conversations took place between Carruthers and Girard regarding how best to translate the visual into the auditory.

Carruthers and Girard struck upon an ingenious solution. They created a geography of the orchestra on a sheet of transparent plastic and used it to map over Carruthers’ art works. Dr. Girard recounts: “We created a transparent overlay of the seating chart and went page by page, figuring out which instruments would take responsibility for which parts of the images.”
