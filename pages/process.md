Laying on her back on top of the ice field, Carruthers listened to the voice of the glacier – the natural environment underneath her, above her, and around her, capturing initial experiences through the lens of her camera and notetaking. These experiences and their outcomes would form the basis of ‘slippages.’

Insert 3 photos of Carruthers photos of the glacier

Carruthers maintains notebooks for each of her projects. The notebook for ‘slippages’ functions as an essential resource for those interested in investigating the artist’s creative process. Assembled over two years, this notebook is comprised of hand-written texts, inspirational preliminary sketches, and special inserts.

Upon returning to Montréal after visiting Athabasca Glacier, Carruthers set to work in her studio, pinning up prints of her photographs to the studio walls and making preliminary drawings for a series of finished paintings.

Carruthers commissioned special hand-made paper for the final images, requesting sheets be made with random holes. As the pages are placed over each other, the holes function metaphorically to stimulate the performer into imagining peering through the surface of the glacier to consider its past. Carruthers states: “With a glacier, the present is on the surface. You are working from the present to the past. Each layer, each sheet of my score is a layer of history.”

In the summer of 2018, Carruthers gathered up the selected 27 paintings that would comprise the ‘slippages’ series and temporarily relocated to Vancouver to work with Orchestra Conductor Dr. Girard and the UBC Symphony Orchestra. Conversations took place between Carruthers and Girard regarding how best to translate the visual into the auditory. Girard and Carruthers struck upon an ingenious solution. They created a geography of the orchestra on a sheet of transparent plastic and used it to map over Carruthers’ art works. Dr. Girard recounts: “We created a transparent overlay of the seating chart and went page by page, figuring out which instruments would take responsibility for which parts of the images.”

Along with the graphic score, Carruthers created a streaming video component that supplied a visual element to enliven the aural experience. (Potentially more information when we have it in hand.)
