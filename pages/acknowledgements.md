‘Slippages’ website was a collaborative effort involving colleagues from across multiple departmental units:
* UBC Library Music, Art and Architecture Library: Kevin Madill (UBC Music Librarian), Matthew Kaufhold (Graduate Academic Assistant, UBC School of Information).
*	UBC Library Digital Initiatives: Robert Stibravy (Librarian, Digital Projects), Eirian Vining (Digital Project Librarian), Stephanie Savage (Scholarly Communications and Copyright).
*	UBC Library Research Commons: Eka Grguric (Digital Scholarship Librarian), Evan Thornberry (GIS Librarian).
*	UBC Library Rare Books and Special Collections: Krisztina Laszlo (Archivist), Felicia de la Para (Senior Library Assistant), Natalie Trapuzzano (Archives Assistant).
*	UBC Library Woodward Library:  
*	cIRcle: Tara Stephens-Kyte (Digital Repository Librarian).

Two colleagues in particular deserve independent acknowledgement:
*	Eka Grguric for guiding the construction of the website and providing effective solutions to project complications as they arose.
*	Matthew Kaufhold for serving as the primary digitizer, creating resource metadata, participating in website construction, and helping edit website content.

UBC School of Music graciously extended support to ‘slippages’ website creation by way of facilitating performance copyright clearance. Special thanks goes to UBCSO Conductor Dr. Jonathan Girard whose boundless energy and kindness contributed greatly to the success of the enterprise.

Final acknowledgement must be made to the composer/artist, Deborah Carruthers, who generously gave of her time, energy, and commitment to project and website. Thank you, Deborah.

‘Slippages’ and website were funded in part by the Anne Kaplan Endowment, UBC Library. The endowment is used to support the work of Canadian women composers by accessioning primary, archival materials into UBC Library’s Canadian Women Composer Archive Collection. A current listing of participating composers is available through the UBC Library Archives website.

*Thoughts on how to separate acknowledgment of funding for the composition versus the website. Maybe three logos: Canada Council, Peter Wall IAS and UBC Library somewhere???*
