The inclusion of ‘slippages’ in the UBCSO’s 2018-19 concert season offered two primary teaching and learning opportunities:
1.	Challenging aspiring young music professionals to answer the question how to musically interpret visual art as presented in the form of a graphic score. 
2.	Bringing the climate crisis directly into the working lives of student musicians. The performance of ‘slippages’ includes the crumpling and dropping of the pages that make up the score as it is performed by the musicians – both for the resulting sonic properties and to evoke solastalgia, a form of emotional or existential distress suffered by those experiencing the consequences of environmental change.

Following the premier, Dr. Girard created a study score to record decisions made in the execution of the composition to facilitate future performances.

Most importantly, however, ‘slippages’ endures as a marker for student engagement around climate crisis at UBC, both in terms of activities related to their professional studies and as inspiration to action.
