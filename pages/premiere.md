On Friday, October 5th, 2018, ‘slippages’ premiered at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts with the UBC Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Dr. Jonathan Girard. Viewing parties for the broadcast performance took place in cities across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

Programming ‘slippages’ into the orchestra’s 2018 roster provided for two primary teaching and learning moments. Firstly, it challenged aspiring young music professionals to answer the question how to musically interpret visual art as presented in the form of a graphic score. Secondly, ‘slippages’ brought the climate crisis directly into the working lives of student musicians. The performance of ‘slippages’ includes the crumpling and dropping of the pages that make up the score as it is performed – both for the resulting sonic properties and to evoke solastalgia, a form of emotional or existential distress suffered by those experiencing the consequences of environmental change.
